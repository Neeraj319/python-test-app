# Python Test Application

I've made this Python/Flask testing application in order to check my request
headers and basic web functionalities.

## Installing and Running the Application

```
git clone https://github.com/regmicmahesh-org/python-test-app
cd python-test-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

## Endpoints

- / => index.html
- /headers => print all request headers
- /add => add a new number in list
- /view => view all numbers in list
